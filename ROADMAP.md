# Roadmap

## Near Term
- Make the repository public and add screenshots/gifs.
- Add a release tag (v0.1.0) and short release notes.
- Add a short troubleshooting section for common issues (exiftool, HF token, OOM).
- Add a "Support" section in README (Boosty, USD tiers, and clear value for supporters).

## Next
- Add automated CI checks (lint/import, basic node load).
- Publish in ComfyUI Manager/Registry (metadata, publisher setup, and release workflow).
- Add a small test asset and golden metadata example.
